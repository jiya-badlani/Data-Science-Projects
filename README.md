Welcome to my Data Science Project Portfolio! In this repository, you will find projects and analyses that showcase my hands-on experience with data manipulation, machine learning, and data visualization.
## PROJECTS
1. Titanic Survival Prediction:
This project analyses a Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and building a machine learning model.

2. Sales Prediction using Python:
This project focuses on analysing trends using graphs and predicting future sales for a business. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the development of a predictive model.

3. Credit Card Fraud Detection:
This project analyses credit card transactions and builds a model to predict whether the transaction is fraudulent or not. The project addresses class imbalance, preprocesses data, and uses logistic regression for classification.
